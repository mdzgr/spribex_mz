<p>Welcome to the online questionnaire for the study “Picture descriptions” FETC-GW-
LK23-144-01</p>
Thank you for taking part in our study!
In this study, we ask you to select images on the basis of very short descriptions. You will
see three cards and one description and choose the card you think best fits the
description. You will need to do this 35 times and in addition you need to answer three questions about the survey. 
All of this will take on average 8 minutes. You
will be compensated £1.20. <br>
This is an anonymous study, meaning that we will not record
any information that could identify you.
Compensation can and will only happen if you complete the study. If you do, you'll receive a completion link at 
the end of the survey, which signals  
to Prolific that you took part in the study. If you quit or withdraw from the
study, you will not get any compensation. The study is funded by the Dutch Research
Council (NWO) and conducted at the Institute for Language Sciences, part of Utrecht
University.<br>
This research is conducted by dr. Rick Nouwen: r.w.f.nouwen@uu.nl. Use this email
address for any questions about the study.<br>
The only data we will collect from you is which choices you click on. Neither your Prolific ID
nor your IP address will be stored with your responses. The response data
will be retained for at least 10 years.<br>
Participation is voluntary. If you decide not to participate, you do not have to take any
further action. If you decide to participate, you can always change your mind and stop
participating at any time, including during the study. Please note that this will affect your
reimbursement; please see above.<br>
This study has been approved by the Faculty Ethics Assessment Committee of the Faculty
of Humanities (FEtC-H). If you have a complaint about the way this study is carried out,
