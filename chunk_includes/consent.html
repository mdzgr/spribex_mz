This letter will inform you about the anonymous online experiment you were invited to participate in. 
The purpose of this experiment is to study your understanding about the beliefs of others, in a so-called belief task. 
In this task, you are asked to predict the behaviour of people in multiple situations, based on their beliefs. <br>
The research is conducted by Mădălina Zgreabăn, master student at Utrecht University. 
The researcher with final responsibility for the study is Dr. Rick Nouwen (r.w.f.nouwen@uu.nl). <br>
In this experiment, you will be asked a question before every situation. 
Then, more context about the situation is presented to help you answer the question. 
After reading the context, you can choose your answer from multiple options. The experiment will take 15 minutes. 
You will receive 2,80 euros upon completing the experiment. 
In case you withdraw from the experiment before you finish it, you will not receive any payment. <br>
The data that we will collect is your multiple choice-answers and your reading times of the scenario sentence.

The collected data will be used only for the purposes stated in the current letter.
